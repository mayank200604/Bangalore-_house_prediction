The Bangalore House Price Prediction project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Web-based interface for users to input property details and get price predictions

This project aims to make house price prediction accessible and intuitive for both real estate professionals and general users



## Features

- Predict house prices based on user input features:
  - Location
  - Square footage
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Number of bathrooms
- Uses a trained machine learning model for predictions
- Simple and interactive web interface (optional)


## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `flask` / `fastapi` (for web server, if applicable)
  - `pickle` (for model serialization)
- Gradio or Streamlit (optional, for UI)

- ## Dataset

- The dataset contains historical housing data from Bangalore.
- Features include location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and price.
- The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and used to train the predictive model.
